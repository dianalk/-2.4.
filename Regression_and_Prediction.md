# Regression and Prediction


KEY IDEAS
The regression equation models the relationship between a response variable Y and a predictor variable X as a line.

A regression model yields fitted values and residualsâ€”predictions of the response and the errors of the predictions.

Regression models are typically fit by the method of least squares.

Regression is used both for prediction and explanation.
