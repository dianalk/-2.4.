KEY IDEAS
Multiple linear regression models the relationship between a response variable Y and multiple predictor variables X1,...,Xp.

The most important metrics to evaluate a model are root mean squared error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2).

The standard error of the coefficients can be used to measure the reliability of a variableâ€™s contribution to a model.

Stepwise regression is a way to automatically determine which variables should be included in the model.

Weighted regression is used to give certain records more or less weight in fitting the equation.
